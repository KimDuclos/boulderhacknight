				<h2>What is it?</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				Tuesday Hack Night is Boulder's premier weekly gathering for programmers, designers, hardware hackers, and other technically minded folks. It's an aggressively unstructured way to hack amongst peers, converse about the vagaries of this or that methodology of developmental arts, or simply to partake of delicious libations in delightful company.
			</p>
			<p>
				There's no agenda, no presentations, no requirements, and hackers and the hacker-curious of all levels are welcome to attend.

				Naught but merriment, hacking, and chatter from 20-40 of your favorite kind of people, milling about between some handy desks, a comfortable sofa, and the libation-purveying establishment next door.
			</p>
			<p>
				You should feel welcome to come, sit down, and hack quietly amongst peers, or just as welcome to come, sit down, and argue about type systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of our most frequent members had a great experience when they first arrived with a question to ask: "What kind of database should I use for this project?", or "Why should I care about type systems?", or "I hear about this Ruby on Rails thing: how's it better than PHP?" These questions, and many more, can be answered for you by many of our attendees, often vigorously.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're shy, one of our fine greeters will be happy to introduce you to like-minded wizards of analytical enginery, or non-like minded, for the more pugnacious of you. Just walk up to one of these fine people and say hello!
